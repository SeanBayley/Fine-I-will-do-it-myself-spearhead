  "lore": "<h2>The Deathless Legions</h2><p>The <strong>Ossiarch Bonereapers</strong> are the elite undead warriors of Nagash, the Supreme Lord of the Undead. Unlike the mindless shambling hordes of other undead, the Ossiarch Bonereapers are intelligent, disciplined, and utterly devoted to their master's will.</p><h3>The Great Work</h3><p>Created by Nagash through the <strong>Great Work</strong>, the Ossiarch Bonereapers are not simply reanimated corpses, but carefully crafted undead warriors. Each one is built from the bones of countless fallen warriors, their souls bound together and shaped into the perfect instruments of death.</p><h3>Bone Tithe</h3><p>The Ossiarch Bonereapers collect the <em>Bone Tithe</em> from all the realms, gathering the remains of the fallen to fuel their endless armies. This is not mere collection - it is a systematic, organized process that ensures Nagash's legions never run short of material for their undead warriors.</p><h3>Mortisan Hierarchy</h3><p>The Ossiarch Bonereapers are led by the <strong>Mortisan</strong> - powerful necromancers who serve as both commanders and craftsmen. These undead sorcerers are responsible for maintaining the legions, creating new warriors, and ensuring that Nagash's will is carried out with perfect precision.</p><h3>Spearhead Operations</h3><p>In the smaller conflicts of the Spearhead campaigns, the Ossiarch Bonereapers deploy their most versatile warriors. <strong>Mortek Guard</strong> form the backbone of their forces - heavily armored, disciplined, and utterly devoted to Nagash's cause. <strong>Kavalos Deathriders</strong> provide mobility and shock tactics, while <strong>Mortisan Soulmasons</strong> bring devastating necromantic magic to the battlefield.</p><p>Every Ossiarch Bonereaper fights not for personal glory, but for the eternal dominion of Nagash. They are the deathless legions that will conquer all the realms, the perfect warriors of an undying empire.</p>",
