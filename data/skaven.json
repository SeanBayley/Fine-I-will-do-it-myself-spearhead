  "lore": "<h2>The Great Horned Rat's Children</h2><p>The <strong>Skaven</strong> are a vast, teeming horde of rat-men who dwell in the depths beneath the Mortal Realms. Led by the <em>Great Horned Rat</em>, these cunning, treacherous creatures seek to spread their influence across all the realms through a combination of overwhelming numbers, devious technology, and dark magic.</p><h3>The Under-Empire</h3><p>Beneath every major city in the Mortal Realms lies a vast network of tunnels, warrens, and underground cities known as the <strong>Under-Empire</strong>. Here, millions of Skaven toil in endless warrens, breeding, scheming, and preparing for the day when they will rise to claim the surface world as their own.</p><h3>Clan Structure</h3><p>Skaven society is divided into <strong>Great Clans</strong>, each with its own specialized role in the Under-Empire. <em>Clan Verminus</em> provides the vast hordes of clanrats and stormvermin, while <em>Clan Skryre</em> develops the deadly war-machines and weapons that give the Skaven their technological edge.</p><h3>The Council of Thirteen</h3><p>The Skaven are ruled by the <strong>Council of Thirteen</strong> - a group of the most powerful and cunning Skaven lords, each representing one of the Great Clans. Their meetings are filled with treachery, backstabbing, and constant attempts to gain advantage over their rivals, for such is the nature of Skaven politics.</p><h3>Spearhead Warfare</h3><p>In the smaller conflicts of the Spearhead campaigns, the Skaven deploy their most versatile and cunning warriors. <strong>Clanrats</strong> form the backbone of their forces - numerous, expendable, and utterly devoted to the Great Horned Rat. <strong>Stormvermin</strong> provide elite melee combat, while <strong>Warlock Engineers</strong> bring devastating war-machines to the battlefield.</p><p>Every Skaven warrior fights not for personal glory, but for the advancement of their clan and the ultimate victory of the Great Horned Rat. They are the vermin that will inherit the realms, the plague that will consume all that stands in their way.</p>",
