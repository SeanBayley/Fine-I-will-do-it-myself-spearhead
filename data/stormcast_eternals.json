  "lore": "<h2>The Warriors of Azyr</h2><p>The <strong>Stormcast Eternals</strong> are the chosen warriors of Sigmar, the God-King of Azyr. Forged in the celestial furnaces of Azyrheim, these immortal warriors are humanity's greatest champions, reforged in lightning and tempered by divine purpose.</p><h3>The Reforging Process</h3><p>When a mortal hero dies in service to Sigmar, their soul is captured by the <em>Lightning Gheists</em> and brought to the <strong>Celestial Realm</strong>. There, in the great forges of Azyrheim, they are reforged into Stormcast Eternals - their mortal flesh replaced with sigmarite, their souls bound to the will of the God-King.</p><h3>Chambers and Hosts</h3><p>Stormcast Eternals are organized into <strong>Chambers</strong> - specialized formations designed for specific battlefield roles. The <em>Warrior Chambers</em> form the backbone of the army, while <em>Vanguard Chambers</em> provide reconnaissance and rapid deployment capabilities.</p><h3>The Price of Immortality</h3><p>Each time a Stormcast Eternal falls in battle, they are reforged again. But with each reforging, they lose a piece of their humanity. Their memories fade, their emotions dull, and they become more like the divine weapons they were forged to be. This is the <strong>Curse of Reforging</strong> - the price of eternal service to Sigmar.</p><h3>Spearhead Operations</h3><p>The Vigilant Brotherhood stride forth as Sigmarâ€™s shining wardens against encroaching shadow. The <strong>Lord-Vigilant</strong> hunts from the saddle of his fierce Gryph-stalker, a living embodiment of divine pursuit. At his side, the <strong>Lord-Veritant</strong> wields sacred flame and scripture to expose heresy wherever it hides. <strong>Liberators</strong> hold the line in unyielding ranks while winged <strong>Prosecutors</strong> descend from the heavens, their hammers striking like thunder to cleanse the realms in Azyr's name.</p>",
